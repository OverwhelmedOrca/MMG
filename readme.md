1.  entire restaurant card is link, fix that

2.  fix the ratio of the cards -- make the cards more like tik tok cards, so one at a time. and fix the link issue

3.  add two or more users and communicate between them -- they are friends and one are not friend, so we can also test recommending adding new random people. I'm guessing we will have to create some form of backend where user's information will be stored, so that it could be accessed and edited as the user edits their preferences.

4.  once you try to create an invite and on the window to create invite you will choose the day and time and select your friends, [[[[also check the box where you are okay with randos ]]]],where who you wanna invite and send it
