1.  entire restaurant card is link, fix that

2.  fix the ratio of the cards -- make the cards more like tik tok cards, so one at a time. and fix the link issue, currently the entire card is a link to the yelp website.

3.  add two or more users and communicate between them -- they are friends and one are not friend, so we can also test recommending adding new random people. I'm guessing we will have to create some form of backend where user's information will be stored, so that it could be accessed and edited as the user edits their preferences.

4.  once you try to create an invite and on the window to create invite you will choose the day and time and select your friends, the app will automatically based on everyone's availability try to find the most common time even if others are busy in interval of atleast 2 hours (the most free time across all the choosigs, favoring the creator of the invite) and  ***[also check the box where you are okay with randos ]***,  where who you wanna invite and send it to the friends you chose, and then u send the invite. Now you will also choose enable forwarding which will allow people who you sent invite to, be able to be sent to other people, increasing the total number of people.

5.  once someone sends you the invite you receive it as red or green, based on whether you are available at that time or not, and also contains the total number of people and list dropdown of who that invite has been sent to, and who has accepted and who has rejected. From there you can do three actions:
   TWO CASES:
CASE #1: THE INVITE IS GREEN
   a. accept it which will, prompt you to be added to the calendar and you will add it to the calendar. It will be stored in a different tab called upcoming events where that event will show up, with number of people who that invite was sent to and number of them who accepted the invite, with the dropdown list of people who accepted the invite who rejected the invite and who are still pending.
   b. reject it which will delete the invite, and if someone has accepted that invite the total number for that invite will decrease and you will be removed from the list
   c. if the original creator has allowed forwarding you can share the invite to other people.
CASE #2: THE INVITE IS RED
if the invite is red, which means you are not available at that time, remember that the time favors mostly the original creator's free time.
   a. you can still accept it although you will have overlapping events in your calendar, you can deal with that however you want.
   b. you can reject it which will do the above discussed
   c. you can forward it.




Also include this feature in recommendation that, the restaurants that your friends prefer show up first. basically implement a shorting function.


make users green, yellow, or red based on their chances of accepting the invite

add calendar events for users

logic for preferences of your friend
